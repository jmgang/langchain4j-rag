### My Demo at JUGPH's Meetup 10 on optimizing RAG architectures using Langchain4j and AWS
This repository demonstrates examples of different RAG optimizations such as Query Expansion, Query Compression, Query Routing, Metadata Filtering, Reranking and RAG-Fusion. 
This repository demonstrates how you can build a RAG application using Amazon Web Services Bedrock, RDS - Postgres as a Vector Store (using PgVector extension already built-in in RDS) and S3, and integrating that into a java application using Langchain4j.
Note: In order to run the code and examples, please fill out your own keys in the config file.
